The revision is not valid because you didn't follow the policies for revising checkpoints sent by email a few weeks ago. 

Your revisions folder was supposed to have the following docs: 

1. The original milestone1.pdf (with all the checkpoints without edits)
2. The new milestone1.pdf with all the revisions
3. A write up pdf file with a description of all the components that were modified. 

Since you didn't follow the revision policies, I can't regrade your work.
